                <p1><center> I cannot seem to get you out of my head
                    The way you walk, the way you talk, the way your eyes shine.
                    I cannot seem to understand the way you bend your head to listen to every word I say
                    And the way things between us are never dull or gray.</center> </p1>
                
                <p2><center>I cannot seem to get you out of my mind.
                    The way you listen, the way you react, the way your smile never dies.
                    I cannot seem to explain the fullness that I feel.
                    Sometimes looking at you, it all seems so surreal.</center></p2>
                
                <p3><center> I can't seem to get you out of my mind.
                     The way my heart races when I see you, the way I don't want to say goodbye.
                     I can't seem to fathom why you talk to me as much as you do,
                     But I love it, and I can honestly say I adore you, too.</center></p3>
