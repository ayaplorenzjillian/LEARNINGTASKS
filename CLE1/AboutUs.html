            <center> <img src="GAYFLAG.jpg"width="500" height="400"></center>
                <h4><center> TRADITIONAL GAY PRIDE FLAG   </center></h4>
                <p>This is the most common flag seen flown at pride festivals and other LGBTQIA+ events. This flag has gone through many changes since its debut in 1977. Originally an 8 color flag, this moving symbol was created by veteran, Gilbert Baker, after Harvey Milk asked him to come up with a symbol of pride for the gay community. The original flag was inspired by Judy Garland’s “Over the Rainbow.”

Each color holds a powerful meaning.

Red: life and sexuality

Orange: healing and friendship 

Yellow: vitality and energy

Green: serenity and nature

Blue: harmony and artistry

Violet: spirit and gratitude</p>

            <h3> PHILADELPHIA PEOPLE OF COLOR INCLUSIVE FLAG </h3>

                <h4><center> PHILADELPHIA PEOPLE OF COLOR INCLUSIVE FLAG </center></h4>
                <p>Historically, queer people of color were often not fully included in the LGBTQIA+ community. At bars and festivals, queer people of color were often faced with harmful and sometimes violent discrimination. Because of this, the city of Philadelphia added black and brown to the flag in honor of the many underrepresented queer people of color. </p>

                <h4><center> PROGRESS PRIDE FLAG </center></h4>
                <p> This flag takes Philadelphia’s idea a bit further. Designed by Daniel Quasar, this flag seeks to include queer and non-binary individuals, as well people of color who identify within the margins of the LGBTQIA+ community. </p>

                <h4> <center> TRANSGENDER FLAG </center> </h4>
                <p> The trans flag was created in 1999 by Monica Helms, a trans woman. The flag was first flown at a Pride Parade in Phoenix in 2000. The light blue represents boys, and the pink represents girls. The white is used to symbolize those who are transitioning, those who feel they have a neutral gender or no gender and those who are intersex. The pattern was strategically picked so that, regardless of which way you fly the flag, it will always be correct. Helms chose this orientation to symbolize those trying to find correctness in their own lives. </p>
