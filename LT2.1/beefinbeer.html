    <b>Method</b>
    <ol>
        
    <li>Raw beef, roll it in the flour...fry 4-‐5 pieces at a time in a hot saucepan to 
        seal...put to one side when all done</li>

<li>Cut the onions into quarters...fry in the same frying pan as the beef...to soak up 
the juices...</li>

<li>Towards the end of frying the onion (they should be nicely brown round the 
        edges) throw in the smashed up cloves of garlic.</li>

<li>Transfer the beef, onions, garlic to a deep casserole dish. Stir in the remaining 
flour</li>

<li>pour on the bottle of beer -‐ really, it isn't going to be wasted!!!</li> 

<li>Cover, and cook at 150 for about 2 and a half hours...will be gorgeous when it 
comes out, trust me...serve with mash</li>
